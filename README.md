# chicken3421

Utility library for tutorials, homework, and assignments.

Check back later for more documentation on just what this provides.
Alternatively, you can read the documentation in the header files.

This library depends on the main course dependencies i.e. glad, glfw, glm, and stb.

It does so via submodules, so you will need to clone this repo via
```bash
$> git clone --recurse https://gitlab.cse.unsw.edu.au/COMP3421/21T3/chicken3421 
```

If you don't do this, you will need to manually grab the transitive dependencies with `git submodule update`.
